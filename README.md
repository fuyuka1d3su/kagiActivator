Kagi Activator is a piece of software that I built to MAINLY help people who are building PCS to activate their machines without having the hassle of going into Windows' horrible settings menu.
It runs on the `Windows Forms` base in `C#` and requires `0` dependency to run.
<br>
<br>
It also reads your Windows Edition to help you input the correct key to activate Windows and even gives you the option to deactivate in case you want to change licenses !

# How to run ??
You can download or compile the binaries yourself from the releases tab or from cloning the repository !

Make sure to also have your key for activation in a text file called `key.txt`.

# Nah but seriously, why did you create this ???

I always wanted an easy utility to activate new Windows systems without having to look for that one script with all my totally legit keys on my PC.
This program also serves as a utility to check if your Windows system is actually activated beforehand, which can be very useful.

# Compiling Instructions

1. Have Visual Studio 2022
2. Clone the repo and open the project in Visual Studio 2022
3. Build the project and you should be good !

# Dependencies
There are 0 dependencies needed for Kagi to run. It uses a version of .NET already preinstalled on most Windows machines. This was one of the goals I wanted to achieve with Kagi too.
